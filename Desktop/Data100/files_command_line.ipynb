    "CLI tools often take one or more arguments, similar to how Python functions take arguments. In the shell, we wrap arguments with spaces, not with parentheses and commas. The arguments appear at the end of the command line, and they are usually the name of a file or some text. In the ls example above, the argument to ls is figures/. Additionally, CLI tools support flags that provide additional options. These flags are specified immediately following the command name using a dash as a delimiter. In the ls example above, we provided the flags -l (to provide extra information about each file) and -h (to provide filesizes in a more human-readable format). Many commands have default arguments and options, and the man command prints a list of acceptable options, examples, and defaults for any command. For example, man ls describes the 30 or so flags available for ls."
