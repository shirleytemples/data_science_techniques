The wrangling process often reshapes the data frame in some way to make the analysis easier and more natural. These changes can simply be taking a subset of the rows and/or columns of the table, changing its granularity, and reshaping. In this section, we’ll use the techniques from Chapter 6 to show how to modify structure."

Or, if we want to focus on a particular period of time or geographic area we may want to take a subset of the rows 1. In Section 8.5, we read into our data frame a small set of features from the hundreds available in the DAWN survey because we were interested in understanding the patterns of type of ER visit by demographics of the patient. Later, in Section %s, we restrict an analysis of home sale prices to one year and a few cities in an effort to limit the impact of inflation and to better study the effect of location on sale price."

In both of these examples, we adjust the granularity of the data frame to work with a coarser granularity by grouping together records and then aggregating values. Recall that for the CO2 measurements, we grouped the monthly values from the same year, and then aggregated the average CO2 measurements:"
